        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I am a junior at the Colorado School of Mines, pursuing Computer Science with a
          focus on Robotics and Intelligent Systems and a minor in Electrical Engineering. I am passionate
          about robots, software, and electronics, and I am particularly fascinated by the applications of
          Computer Vision and other sensors.

          I am also an IB Diploma Recipient. As part of the IB Diploma program,
          I developed a Solder Workshop class that allowed younger students with no experience in
          Electronics to solder and create a LED lightboard with a customizable flash pattern.
